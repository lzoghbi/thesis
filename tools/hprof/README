The script in this directory can parse a heap dump from an android java app 
and generate the list of classes that have been loaded. 

To generate a class list do the following:
// get the process id of the app
adb shell ps | grep YOUR_APP_NAME (FIXME: second numeric value is the pid)
// tell activity manager to dump the heap. You'll need root for this on the phone
adb shell am dumpheap <pid> /data/local/tmp/SOMEDUMP.hprof
// copy the heap to your host computer
adb pull /data/local/tmp/SOMEDUMP.hprof YOUR_DIR_HERE/.
// pass the heap dump to the python script for parsing and printing out the class list
python dump_classes_from_hprof.py --hprof YOUR_DIR_HERE/SOMEDUMP.hprof > list_of_classes.txt
